# BRUUS Coffee Shop POS System
## Project Charter and Documentation

---

## 1. BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF THE SYSTEM

### What is BRUUS?
BRUUS is a modern coffee shop management system designed for iPad tablets. It helps coffee shop owners in Butuan City manage their daily operations more easily and efficiently.

### The Problem We're Solving
Coffee shops in Butuan City have grown rapidly in the last 5 years. Many shop owners still use old-fashioned methods to:
- Track their inventory (coffee beans, milk, cups, etc.)
- Process customer orders
- Calculate daily sales
- Manage staff access to business information

These manual methods cause problems like:
- Running out of ingredients without warning
- Slow customer service
- Mistakes in calculating money
- No way to see which products sell best
- Staff having access to sensitive business data

### Our Solution: BRUUS System
We created BRUUS to solve these problems with:
- **Automatic inventory tracking** - knows when you're running low on supplies
- **Fast order processing** - easy to use on iPad tablets
- **Smart sales reports** - shows which products make the most money
- **Secure access** - only owners can see sensitive information
- **Works offline** - continues working even without internet
