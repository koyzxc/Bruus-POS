# BRUUS Coffee Shop POS System - Complete Documentation

## I. INTRODUCTION

### A. OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

The **BRUUS Unified POS and Inventory Platform with Automated Alerts** is a cutting-edge, iPad 10-optimized solution designed specifically for Philippine coffee shop operations. Built with React + TypeScript frontend, Node.js backend, and PostgreSQL + SQLite hybrid database architecture, it delivers seamless sales processing, real-time inventory management, and comprehensive business analytics with full offline capability.

#### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Current coffee shop POS systems in the Philippines suffer from critical operational inefficiencies:
- **Inadequate security frameworks** with no role-based access control, exposing sensitive financial data to unauthorized staff
- **Manual inventory management** requiring constant human intervention, leading to stock-outs and overordering
- **Absence of intelligent alerts** for low-stock situations, causing service disruptions during peak business hours
- **Desktop-only interfaces** incompatible with modern tablet-based workflows, reducing operational efficiency
- **Limited business intelligence** with no sales analytics or product performance tracking capabilities
- **System reliability issues** including frequent crashes, performance lag, and complete failure during internet outages
- **Currency limitations** with poor or no Philippine Peso (₱) support for local market operations

### a. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
The BRUUS system comprehensively addresses these challenges by:
- **Implementing enterprise-grade role-based authentication** with Owner and Barista access levels, securing sensitive business data
- **Delivering automated real-time inventory synchronization** with intelligent low-stock alerting and automatic ingredient deduction
- **Providing actionable business intelligence** through comprehensive sales analytics, product performance tracking, and non-selling item identification
- **Establishing iPad 10-first responsive design** with touch-optimized interface elements and intuitive navigation workflows
- **Enabling robust offline-first operation** with local SQLite backup and automatic cloud synchronization upon reconnection
- **Supporting complete Philippine market localization** including native ₱ currency formatting, realistic pricing ranges (₱100-150), and local business process optimization

### b. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS

**Comprehensive Project Scope:**
- **Complete POS ecosystem** featuring order processing, payment calculation, receipt generation, and role-based user authentication
- **Advanced inventory management platform** with real-time stock tracking, automated alerts, multi-unit measurements (ml, g, kg, pc, oz), and ingredient usage calculations
- **Business intelligence dashboard** providing sales analytics, product performance insights, daily/weekly reporting, and strategic decision-making data
- **iPad 10-optimized responsive architecture** ensuring seamless touch interaction, intuitive layouts, and coffee shop workflow optimization
- **Hybrid cloud-local data synchronization** enabling continuous operation during connectivity issues with automatic sync restoration
- **Philippine market specialization** including ₱ currency support, local pricing optimization, cash-heavy transaction workflows, and regulatory compliance

**Defined System Limitations:**
- **Supply chain integration scope:** Provides low-stock alerts but excludes direct automated supplier ordering systems
- **Menu complexity boundaries:** Optimized for coffee shop operations, excludes complex multi-course restaurant features
- **Connectivity dependencies:** Offline mode maintains core functionality but delays real-time analytics until reconnection
- **Geographic scaling:** Single-location architecture, multi-branch operations require separate implementation
